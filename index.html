                            <div class="summary">Building a team for a business client</div>

                            <div class="details">
                                <p>I was asked to completely overhaul a team of ~10 people for one of my business clients (GroundZero Gaming). They had come to employ my services as I had a pre-existing reputation for being able to identify the required skill-set for the job. They had finished in 7th place the previous year, and had never even come close to a top 5 position in their history. There was also a shortage of readily available talent in some of the roles, as it was late into the off-season.
                                </p>

                                <p>I knew that I needed to find people who were skilled enough for the roles required, and also needed to ensure that the team environment would be a productive and healthy one. To do this, I needed to assess the personality of each team member, and how they would work together. I also had a limited budget to play with, and needed to ensure everybody was happy. The budget was about 300% smaller than the largest competitor, so it was a tall task.</p>

                                <p>Initial screening mostly invovled screening for skills and aptitude. The interview process then involved a personality assessment. I reached out to previous colleagues/managers of the people of interest, and enquired specifically about growth mindsets, high levels of self-accountability, and self-drive. I found a member who ticked all the boxes and seemed like an exceptional candidate, so I ended up allocating a large chunk of the budget to that person. As a result, I had to settle for less-than-ideal members in other positions. I figured that since the exceptional candidate displayed strong leadership skills, I wanted to empower him to elevate the skillsets of the other members. </p>

                                <p>Despite the significant financial disadvantage and a history of poor results, the team managed to take home two back-to-back championships in 2024, the first time in history for the organisation. Off the back of the success, the team managed to secure a spot in international competition, and now compete in Asia. The team also reported an increase of 800% in prize money earnings for 2024, compared to the previous year. </p>

                            <div class="details">
                                <p>One of my clients was struggling to find use out of the resources I had directed him to. For context, the resources were mainly video recordings of the peformance of other professionals. I had referred him to it so that he could learn from them.</p>

                                <p>Usually, I would refer clients to a video example I had created on how to analyse recordings. In this case, however, I realised that this particular client needed a more personalised approach, as I saw that he was struggling to express his concerns. I then opened up a recording myself and demonstrated what I would personally take away from the recording, and gave multiple examples for the client. This took ~10 minutes more than the time that was normally planned, but I wanted the customer to be fully satisfied in the service I had given him.</p>

                                <p>I then followed up with some text messages in the following week, checking in on the clients progress and any additional concerns. Overall, the client was quite happy and seemed more trusting of me, which worked to strengthen our relationship.</p>

                                <p>One of my regular clients made an unreasonable request. For context, I was providing a regular coaching service to this client for a few months, and he had asked me if I could join him in a social activity. I immediately recognised that this was a veiled attempt at getting me to boost the client's rank, which is an illegal practice. 
                                </p>

                                <p>While the obvious answer was to decline the client's request, I realised the client's request was a deep expression of hopelessness, as it seemed as though he had given up on his own personal journey of improvement. So I asked some probing questions regarding his mentality, such as : "Do you have hope that you will improve?". It was clear that the client was struggling with his mentality.</p>

                                <p>I then had an extensive discussion with the client regarding mentality, and realised he required alot of positive reinforcement. I then altered the service I was providing by curating my service to be more focused around having a positive growth mindset. I stopped trying to teach the client any technical skills and begun a performance mindset and mentality program with the client.</p>

                                <p>As a result, the client steadily improved his mindset over the coming weeks, and it was reflected in his performance and progress. I continued to regularly monitor his mindset during the remainder of our relationship.</p>

                            <div class="details">
                                <p>During my time on GroundZero Gaming, I noticed that the performance of one of my team members was lagging behind the rest of the team.</p>

                                <p>Having spent months together at this point, I had come to realise that this team member places a lot of importance on his performance and holds himself to a very high standard. I figured that he was the kind of person to overthink his own performance as he strives for excellence, and this would end up having an adverse affect. I pulled him aside for a private conversation, without letting any of the other team members know.</p>

                                <p>I opened the conversation by highlighting some of the things I thought he did really well. He thanked me, and let me know that he was under alot of pressure because he felt as though he would get replaced, since he was lagging behind the rest of the team. I reassured him that he was chosen for a reason, and that every single person on the team believes in him. I then told him that it is normal to have flucuations in performance, and that we win and lose as a team, and that I want him to focus on just having fun.</p>

                                <p>The following day in practice, it seemed like a huge amount of pressure was relieved off his shoulders. I then made sure to give him postive words of affirmation during practice, and the other team members started to join in as well. He thanked me afterwards and our relationship was strengthened as a result. </p>

                            <div class="details">
                                <p>One of my team members was severely underperforming, and was being disruptive to the team environment. I had already privately spoken to him on 3 occasions prior regarding his behaviour and performance. In this particular case, he was starting to get quite defensive and aggressive during a routine team review, and it was affecting the other team members.</p>

                                <p>I immediately tried to descalate the situation by speaking in a calm yet firm voice and addressing the team member directly. He then started to insult me. I then reprimaned his behaviour in front of all the other team members. I made sure to focus on his behaviour, and not on who he is as a person. I refrained from using 'you' statements, in order not to offend him. I felt as though that it was time to reprimand him publically in order to set an example, and that any sort of disruptive behaviour and disrespect towards other team members was unacceptable. I told him to take a 10 minute break.</p>

                                <p>I then had a private conversation with him and informed him that his behvaiour was unacceptable. I also mentioned that I knew that he is a very good person and that I love working with him as a teammate. I emphasised that healthy disagreements between teammates are not only encouaraged but absolutely necessary in building a positive and high-performing team environment, whereas disruptive behaviour is unacceptable. I assured him that the way that he felt was completely valid and understandable, and that I was proud of him for having the courage to express disagreement, but I needed him to express it in a much healthier way. </p>

                                <p>He then apologised to the other team members and resolved to improve the way that he communicates moving forward. I directed him to a resource that detailed how to express negative emotions in a healthy way, especially in the workplace. His communication and performance improved as a result over the coming weeks.</p>
